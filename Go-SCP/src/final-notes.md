Final Notes
===========

The Checkmarx Research team is confident that this Go Secure Coding Practices
Guide provided value to you. We encourage you to refer to it often, as
you're developing applications written in Go. The information found in this
guide can help you develop more-secure applications and avoid the common
mistakes and pitfalls that lead to vulnerable applications. Understanding that
exploitation techniques are always evolving, new vulnerabilities might be found
in the future, based on dependencies that may make your application vulnerable.

OWASP plays an important role in application security. We recommend staying
abreast of the following projects:

* [OWASP Secure Coding Practices - Quick Reference Guide][0]
* [OWASP Top Ten Project][1]
* [OWASP Testing Guide Project][2]
* [Check OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][3]
